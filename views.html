    <li>
    View is a data object which does not contain any data.</li>
    <li> Contents of the view are the resultant of a base table.</li>
    <li> They are operated just like base table but they donâ€™t contain any data of their own.</li>
    <li> The difference between a view and a table is that views are definitions built on top of other tables (or views).</li>
    <li> If data is changed in the underlying table, the same change is reflected in the view.</li>
    <li> A view can be built on top of a single or multiple tables.</li>
